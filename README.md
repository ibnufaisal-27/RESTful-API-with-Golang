RESTful API with Golang

## üèÉ Getting Started
### Requirements
The program must be already installed on your machine:
1. Golang
2. Docker
3. Postman
4. Code Editor (recommended : GoLand from Jetbrain)

Let start setup your machine for the `development environment` ‚öô.

In this section, you need to install several programs which is needed on the development phase.
Just follow the instruction, and you will in set!
**Note : I will write this instruction for Linux Machine**

Install golang (`min version is 1.14`):

sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install golang-go
```

### IDE & Testing Tools
For the better experiences, we are recommend you to use these IDE and testing tools:
1. [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) for main code editor.
2. [Postman](https://www.postman.com) for testing RESTful HTTP API.
3. [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) for sql database management, or
4. [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) for sql database management.


### Set the env
Before you start to run this service, you should set configs with yours.
Create `.env` file. Take a look at: `.env.example`.
```shell script
cp .env.example .env
```
### Config the env
- Set `configuration of your database postgres`


# Fast Running App With Docker Compose
```shell script
 docker-compose up --build
```
# Running Unit Test
```shell script
go test -v ./controllers/... --cover
```
